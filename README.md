Really basic JS made in April as a starting project into JS

Looking back on this I find it funny that just months ago I
was struggling to understand even the most basic things in programming;
glad I pushed through though.

Also on a side note - none of us can figure out where those arrows at 
the top of the page came from, honestly probably didnt look hard enough.
